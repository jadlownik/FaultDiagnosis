Your task is to conduct diagnostic reasoning (DX, FDI approach), 
resulting in providing information about minimal conflicts 
(the smallest sets of system components that could explain the observed malfunctions)
and minimal diagnoses (the smallest sets of components that cannot all be functioning
correctly given the observed problems). To calculate minimal_diagnosis use 
procedure get_diagnosis from <procedure><\procedure> tags.
<procedure>
procedure get_diagnosis(minimal_conflicts):
    diagnosis_collection := [empty set]

    for each conflict in minimal_conflicts do:
        current_diagnoses := copy(diagnosis_collection)

        for each diagnosis in current_diagnoses do:
            if diagnosis is disjoint with conflict then:
                diagnosis_collection := update_diagnosis(diagnosis, diagnosis_collection, conflict)

    for each hitting_set in diagnosis_collection do:
        sort hitting_set in ascending order

    sort diagnosis_collection by length of hitting sets and then lexicographically

    return diagnosis_collection

procedure update_diagnosis(diagnosis, diagnosis_collection, conflict):
    diagnosis_collection := remove diagnosis from diagnosis_collection

    new_diagnoses := []

    for each component in conflict do:
        new_diagnosis := union(diagnosis, {component})
        add new_diagnosis to new_diagnoses

    diagnosis_collection := remove duplicates from diagnosis_collection
    sort each set in diagnosis_collection in ascending order
    convert each set in diagnosis_collection to sets

    return diagnosis_collection

In the examples located between the 
<examples></examples> tags, you have sample input data presented between the 
<input></input> tags. "Relations" are dependencies describing the system, 
with the value before ":" indicating the element where the operation is 
performed and where a fault may potentially occur. "Observations" describe 
some variables in the equations, variables that are used in the equations 
but have no observations are unknown. Sample output data that is correct for 
the described examples is located between the <output></output> tags.
